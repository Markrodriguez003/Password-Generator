IDEAS FOR PASSWORD GENERATOR


++ Add a way of using pressing a badge/icon to copy password to clipboard (done-need to implement js)
++ Add modal when ^^ happens that can exit when clicking out and pressing esc 
++ Add checkboxes to enable added symbols / Upper Case / Lower Case / Numbers / Spaces / 
Have password include a certain word (added by user) (done - need to implement js)
++ Add timer to with "Generating password" maybe with scroll animation? maybe with a modal?
++ Have the unlocked icon turn into a lock icon on top whgen generate button delivers password
++ Have a mini # carousel/pagination for length of password. Cap it at 18. Next to it add a button that engages another
field (from hidden) to enter a custom number amount  max 45. Use the increment/decrement solution created 2 days ago.
++ Have a error loop 
++ Add a loop to check to see if user just clicks on the copy password btn that if it's empty/null/undefined that it shoots 
an error out and loops
++ Create an event onclick for generate button to flash green instead of :active psuedo class. Slow animation.
++ Change log/scratchpad files to .MD (markdown file) instead of .txt
