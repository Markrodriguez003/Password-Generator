IDEAS FOR PASSWORD GENERATOR


++ Add a way of using pressing a badge/icon to copy password to clipboard
++ Add modal when ^^ happens that can exit when clicking out and pressing esc
++ Add checkboxes to enable added symbols / Upper Case / Lower Case / Numbers / Spaces / 
Have password include a certain word (added by user)
++ Add timer to with "Generating password" maybe with scroll animation?


++ Add a loop to check to see if user just clicks on the copy password btn that if it's empty/null/undefined that it shoots 
an error out and loops
